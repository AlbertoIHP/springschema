## AWS CONFIGURATION STEP
![](https://i2.wp.com/www.pcihispano.com/contenido/uploads/2016/10/AWS_Cloud.png?fit=256%2C256&ssl=1)

First thing to do is go to `src/main/java/back/upload` and put `at line 39`, your AWS S3 credentials, where is `"Put here your credentials"` writen.

## MAILING CONFIGURATION STEP 
![](https://cristopherav.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/email-icon.png)

Go to `src/main/java/back/mailing` and `at line 27` your email account for mailing, then `at line 43`, repeat by putting there your email and password.

## VIDEOCHAT CONFIGURATION STEP

Next, got `src/main/java/back/opentok` and `at line 14` put your **API key**, then `at line 15`, your **API secret**. With this you will be able to use videochat, by getting a session and saving it into your bd, in some place in a table. Then by giving this session you will get a token to connect an Front-end application with opentok.

# OTHER CONFIGURATION 

## Change abstract User implementation to your model

* If you need to change the user model you should go to `src/main/java/back/security/model`. Then you will find the `User.java` file, which especifies the table representation.

* If you modify the user model, you should change also at src/main/java/back/security, JwtUser.java and JwtUserFactory.java adding or deleting your new attributes.

## Add new elements to my model (components)

Then to create a **new component** to your app, just create a new folder as this /`src/main/java/back/my-entity-name`, and inside create `my-entity-name.java`, `my-entity-nameRepository.java` and `my-entity-nameRestController.java` following the `src/main/java/back/project` examples.

## Seeders 

To create your own **seeders**, we use **SQL lenguage**, by configuring the database access at `src/main/resources` in the file `import.sql`.

## HTTPS configuration

* To configuring the access, go to src/main/resources at application.yml at lines 18, 19 and 20.

* This project, is configured to run over **SSL certificate**, we actually just create an **self signed certificate**, but getting your own certificate, and changing the name into `keystore.p12` and puting it into `src/main/resources` you will **be able to use your certificate**.

* Then at `src/main/resources` you have to modify your `applciation.properties` and and modify `at line 3` your **KEY**. (bebote34 is te actual key for the self signed **SSL certificate**).

## Maven installation

Finally you have to install Maven in your system, by using the command `sudo apt install maven` then run `mvn spring-boot:run` and system will deploy and create the whole data model in your database **(Rembember to create first in your database engine the database**).

## Scaffolding (Powered by https://github.com/jlmonteagudo/generator-spring-rest-jwt) <3

* First we need install this packages (you must have install npm in your machine) 
`
npm install -g yo;
npm install -g generator-spring-rest-jwt
`

* Then you can create by using the command yo `spring-rest-jwt:resource`, this will auto generate all steps at  Add new elements to my model (components) of this document and below.
